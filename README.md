# FIVE CARD DRAW

Basic five card, multiplayer poker game made using Socket.io and Express. I made this game in span of few weeks in order to learn basics of WebSockets. Project is about 80% done and may never get finished.

## Known bugs / improvements:

- One player might be announced with different winner than others in 3+ player games
  (this seems to be related to player's disconnecting and rejoining existing rooms, havent figured out the exact cause yet)
- Player's balance variable is only cosmetic and isn't limited to positive integers
