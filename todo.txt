- server iterates every id and creates user list from them
this array gets send to a client containing most latest information about players

- after that the array data gets rendered to player's screen

so we need:
------------
-setInterval emitter in server side
-game loop in client side


what next?
------------
-instead of recreating objects everytime, add some conditions to check if they already exists and change their values accordingly
    (socket.on 'send-data') espesially

-add button events
    priority:
    ---------
    1) readyButton
    2) changeButton
    3) foldButton


bug fix ideas:
-------------
remove duplicates from gameObjects array on client side to avoid multiple viewports when someone leaves (DONE)
redirect players if room is full
remove empty rooms

additional:
-----------
change room filling order bot-top-left-right
