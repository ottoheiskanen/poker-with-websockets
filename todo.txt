- server iterates every id and creates user list from them
this array gets send to a client containing most latest information about players

- after that the array data gets rendered to player's screen

so we need:
------------
-setInterval emitter in server side
-game loop in client side


what next?
------------
- create player-, deck- and card-class and game objects array that gets
rendered inside game loop
