- server iterates every id and creates user list from them
this array gets send to a client containing most latest information about players

- after that the array data gets rendered to player's screen

so we need:
------------
-setInterval emitter in server side
-game loop in client side


what next?
------------
-add fold option

- add poker hand evaluation and 'new game' -feature, announce winner on statContainer 
and update player balances accordingly (PARTLY DONE)

-add button events
    priority:
    ---------
    1) readyButton (DONE)
    2) changeButton (DONE)
    3) foldButton


thinking...
------------
should the timer come from server? it seems like 'the first timer to set on' logic is messing up new game start

bug fix ideas:
-------------
remove duplicates from gameObjects array on client side to avoid multiple viewports when someone leaves (DONE)
redirect players if room is full
remove empty rooms

unknown bugs:
---------------
something got messed up when announcing winner - winner didnt match between players
-something to do with 'update-player-state' or pokersolver algorithm???

additional:
-----------
change room filling order bot-top-left-right
